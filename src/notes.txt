warn on template names starting in '-'
flag to expand to "nominal" widths/heights
GUIs 0.45 mode (no clipping, toggle for 0/1)

copying ala text_define_topointer
"open" and "save as" messages to open text window
how to integrate message boxes !?

x_array.c:

    menu item to connect selected objects
    highlight connections (and I/Os) on mouse motion

replace list element with binbuf??
